# Better File Support Extension Pack

VSCode has a great support for common file types. But it can be better.  
To fix this, I made this extension pack that add support for more file types like:

- DotEnv
- XML
- YAML
- TOML

## List of extensions built-in

- DotJoshJohnson.xml
- jock.svg
- mikestead.dotenv
- redhat.vscode-yaml
- tamasfe.even-better-toml

**Enjoy!**
